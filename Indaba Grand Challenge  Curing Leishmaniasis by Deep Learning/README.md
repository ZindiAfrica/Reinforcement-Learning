# Competition Summary

## Description

Leishmaniasis is a neglected disease. As a disease of poverty, it has historically received limited funding for discovery, development and delivery of new tools.

Like a handful of similar diseases, it is the scourge of whole regions affected by them, because we still miss cheap, safe and effective cures for them.

At the same time, new drug candidates are being developed and old ones are being tested every day.

The goal is to propose a new treatment, comprising a Leishmania protein (present in the proteome of one or more of the Leishmania species) and a small molecule (or set of small molecules).

## Competition Rules

Participation in this competition could be as an individual or in a team of up to four people.

Prizes are transferred only to the individual players or to the team leader.

Code was not shared privately outside of a team. Any code shared, was made available to all competition participants through the platform. (i.e. on the discussion boards).


## Datasets and packages

Only the datasets provided for this competition was used.

Use of external data is allowed and data sharing is encouraged. The use of pretrained models was allowed as long as they are openly available to everyone.

Competitors were allowed to access, use, and share competition data for any commercial, non-commercial, research or education purposes, under a CC-BY SA 4.0 license.


## Submissions and winning

The top 3 solution placed on the final leaderboard were required to submit their winning solution code to us for verification, and thereby agreed to assign all worldwide rights of copyright in and to such winning solution to Zindi.


## Reproducibility

The full documentation was retrieved. This includes:
- All data used

- Output data and where they are stored

- Explanation of features used

- The solution must include the original data provided by Zindi and validated external data (no processed data)

- All editing of data must be done in a notebook (i.e. not manually in Excel)


## Data standards:

- The most recent versions of packages were used.

- Submitted code run on the original train, test, and other datasets provided.


## Evaluation:

It was be scored by InstaDeepâ€™s bioinformatics platform using a single evaluation algorithm.

## Prizes

The top 10 submissions will earn up to 3000 Zindi Points.

## Benefits

The solutions will help advance science and save lives by curing a disease.

It could also help identify amongst the already known, tested and (often) approved drugs, potential cures for different forms of leishmaniasis.
